# fractals-js
A fun little project to mess around with TypeScript & fractals. Based on [this video](https://youtu.be/kbKtFN71Lfs) by Numberphile. 

To use, simply open the HTML file, place some points, and click start! Currently only implements the Chaos Game method for 3 points, however, feel free to mess around and see what you can create!
